# Quantum Computation Practice

Hao-Chien Wang

This is a repo where I save all the scripts I used to try the algorithms in 
chapter 3 of the [textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/introduction.html). 
Currently, the result of QFT from a real device was unexpected, but the others
are working fine (I believe). The function of simulation and real device experiment
is defined in [`simulation.py`](https://github.com/fhcwcsy/quantum_computing_practice/simulation.py).
Instructions of how to run `Qiskit` on a Python script instead of Jupyter notebook
can be found [here](https://github.com/fhcwcsy/quantum_computing_practice/script_exp.md).
